<Necromancer> working title?

Idea chamber pot:

player is necromancer that starts off with 5 corpses and 1 zombie juice to make a zombie companion.
Base building and resource collection oriented.
Starts out in straw shack and player has old crazy forest wizard friend who helps them figure out how to upgrade things
making reading and writing books key feature of game
zombie automation and embalming enhancments
stronghold like base building. Wizard fortress/mini city forms around necromancer tower as it upgrades
zombie/human squads can patrol zombie paved roads leading to other towns
story/quest based?
space engineers voxel based resource extraction
magical/medieval level technology. DND like aspects
