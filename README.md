KSP modding folder repo for me and Jay

I have the initial saves we can use to start our project in here. You can clone this repo on your own machine and start making changes. It's best that we coordinate what we work on so that we can add stuff that doesn't interefere with each other. If we can avoid conflicts we can work twice as fast. I'm going to copy and paste a readme I have from earlier.
