<Necromancer> working title?

Idea chamber pot:

player is necromancer that starts off with 5 corpses and 1 zombie juice to make a zombie companion.
Base building and resource collection oriented.
Starts out in straw shack and player has old crazy forest wizard friend who helps them figure out how to upgrade things
making reading and writing books key feature of game
zombie automation and embalming enhancments
stronghold like base building. Wizard fortress/mini city forms around necromancer tower as it upgrades
zombie/human squads can patrol zombie paved roads leading to other towns
story/quest based?
space engineers voxel based resource extraction
magical/medieval level technology. DND like aspects
Magical oil that is largely unknown in the game

main story arc skeleton:

Main player starts in city as office worker
boring normal life ends tragically by isekai
gets hit by a truck and transported to necromancer world
becomes lich by accident as his soul is passing to the afterlife
miniature demon assistant helper fills in details
demon is main Lieutenant for managing the necromancer tower which is made from wattle and straw
single dead squirell is zombified by demon to demonstrate the process
you hunt and zombify wildlife or do the work all on your own if you want
game is a lot easier if you use zombies but you can take the good path by hiring people
or you can go the morally ambiguous route and make zombies to do the work for you
eventually get presented with the opportunity to steal bodies from a battlefield
make warrior/worker zombies
demon tells player secret about magical oil source
player gets gather/build quest to make magical oil drilling rig
magical oil can power magical machinery but needs to be processed first alchemically
same with botany and herbs. Zombies can work fields or greenhouses to farm crops for sale or herbs for potions
